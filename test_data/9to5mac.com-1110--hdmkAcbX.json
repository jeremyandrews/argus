{"body":"We have teamed up with Satechi to offer 9to5 readers exclusive early Black Friday sale pricing on the entire collection of the brand’s wonderful charging accessories, keyboards, and more. This time around we are taking things up a notch with a solid 30% off everything the brand sells sitewide – we are told there are no exclusions here either (you just can’t stack two codes at checkout). Our exclusive promo code works on all of the brand’s 2024 releases as well as items that are already seeing markdowns on the listing pages. Head over to the official Satechi site and apply our exclusive 30OFF9to5 code at checkout to redeem the sale price. But be sure to head below for some of the particular highlights form the sale as well. Exclusive Satechi early Black Friday saleDown below you’ll find some of our personal favorite items in our exclusive early Black Friday Satechi site. These include gear we have gone hands-on with, use ourselves, and would make for wonderful additions to just about any charging or at-home workstation setup, not to mention some great travel gear like its best-in-class Apple Find My Passport wallet and its new 15W Qi2 Wireless Car Charger, among others. Satechi MagSafe charging stands – 30% offSatechi is a top 5 (top 3 for me personally) brand when it comes to the MagSafe charging stand and pad space, especially in the 3-in-1 and 2-in-1 categories. The brand makes my personal favorite upright model with folding capabilities – the Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – and it just unleashed its brand new Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad. The latter of which doubles as both a flat 3-in-1 charging solution as well as an upright stand-style charger for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, complete with Qi2-certified 3-in-1 charging. I have been testing one out here for about a week or so now – it’s really nice (full review coming soon) and is now at the best price ever as part of our exclusive sale event for 9to5 readers using code 30OFF9to5 at checkout.  Satechi Passport wallet with Apple Find My hits best price ever Another particular standout from our exclusive sale event here is the brand’s 2024 Vegan-Leather Passport Cover with Apple Find My. After getting a chance to go hands-on for review with the Find My Passport wallet, it quickly shot to the top my list of the best options on the market – first, it has the Find My tech no Passport wallet should ever release without, and second, it supports wireless MagSafe charging (most of them require a slightly awkward proprietary cable to charge back up). But perhaps best of all, it is now at its best price ever using our exclusive 30OFF9to5 code. Satechi’s Qi2 Wireless Car Charger – one of the best in the game now at its best priceBefore we dive into a look at how exclusive pricing shakes out on the brand’s wonderful Mac keyboards and powerful USB-C wall chargers, I want to quickly highlight the new 2024 Satechi Space Gray Qi2 15W MagSafe Car Charger mount. I also had a chance to test this one out over the summer – I loved it then and am still loving it now. It is a fantastic 15W Qi2 MagSafe charger for your ride, something that almost looks like it could have been designed in Cupertino by Apple, and makes for a fantastic edition to your road trip travel kit, be it for everyday commutes and longer runs. It looks great, works wonderfully, and is easily among the best iPhone car charging mounts I have ever used. It too is now at the lowest we have tracked coming in at $5 under the previous summer all-time low. Satechi Mac and PC backlit keyboards at 30% offMagSafe wallets, best-selling wall chargers, and more Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!
