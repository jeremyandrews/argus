{"body":"After Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 and before Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 a node could be spammed with minimum\ndifficulty headers, which could possibly be leveraged to crash it by OOM.This issue is considered Medium severity.DetailsBefore the introduction of headers\npre-synchronisation, nodes relied exclusively on\ncheckpoints to avoid getting spammed by low-difficulty headers.In Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 a check for headers forking before the last checkpointâ€™s height was moved to\nafter storing the header in mapBlockIndex. This allowed an attacker to grow the map unboundedly by\nspamming headers whose parent is the genesis block (which only need difficulty 1 to create), as such\nblocks bypassed the checkpoint logic.AttributionCredits to Cory Fields for finding and responsibly disclosing the bug.Timeline2017-08-08 Cory Fields privately reports the bug2017-08-11 Pieter Wuille opens PR #11028 to fix it2017-08-14 PR #11028 is merged2017-09-14 Bitcoin Core version 0.15.0 is released with a fix2018-10-03 The last vulnerable version of Bitcoin Core (0.14.3) goes end of life2024-07-03 Public disclosure.","relevance":{"apple":"No","bitcoin":"Yes","drupal":"No","ev":"No","global_vuln":"No","linux_vuln":"No","llm":"No","longevity":"No","rust":"No","space":"No","tuscany":"No"},"title":"Bitcoin Core :: Disclosure of memory DoS using low-difficulty headers"}
