{"body":"Following the launch of the Belkin Head Strap earlier this week, Belkin today is further expanding its accessory lineup for Apple Vision Pro. The company has unveiled its new Belkin Travel Bag as a “compact and lightweight” alternative to Apple’s own Travel Case.The Belkin Travel Bag for Apple Vision Pro gives you another option for transporting your spatial computer. Apple sells its own Travel Case for Vision Pro, but it comes with a hefty price tag and a relatively bulky design. Here’s how Belkin describes its Travel Bag for Apple Vision Pro: The Travel Bag is designed to protect Apple Vision Pro when taking it on-the-go. It is compact and lightweight and can be carried using the handle, or with the adjustable straps in either shoulder or cross-body style. The multi-compartment design keeps Vision Pro and accessories, such as the battery, power adapter and head bands — all organized and easily accessible. It is engineered with an internal flap and cushioned base for additional protection. The deep front zipper makes access easy, and additional pockets allow for extra storage for personal items. The Travel Bag is made with lightweight, high-performance fabric for durability, and comes in a timeless space gray color option. You can order the Belkin Travel Bag from the Apple website for $99.95. It will also be available at select Apple Stores starting this week.Another Vision Pro case optionAnother great option if you’re in the market for a Vision Pro case is the Shield Case from Waterfield Designs. I’ve been using this one since February and it’s a beautifully-designed, compact option for Apple Vision Pro users. You can order the Shield Case from the Waterfield Designs website for $159 or $179 depending on the material you choose.
