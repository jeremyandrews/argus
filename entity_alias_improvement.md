# Entity Alias System Improvements

## Overview of Changes

We've improved the entity alias system by:

1. **Removed Static Hardcoded Aliases**: 
   - Migrated from in-memory static maps to a fully database-backed approach
   - This allows for easier management and expansion of alias sets

2. **Preserved Fuzzy Matching Capabilities**:
   - Kept the advanced fuzzy matching algorithms for handling variations
   - Made the fuzzy matching code more accessible through a public API

3. **Fixed Circular Dependencies**:
   - Restructured code to avoid circular references between normalizer.rs and aliases.rs
   - Created clear separation of concerns between different components

4. **Improved Transitive Relationship Support**:
   - Added support for multi-hop relationships (A→B→C) 
   - Ensured proper normalization for alias matching

## System Components

The entity alias system now consists of these key components:

1. **Database Storage** (in db.rs):
   - Aliases stored in the `entity_aliases` table
   - Support for approval workflows and tracking

2. **Normalization** (in normalizer.rs):
   - Consistent text normalization across the system
   - Public fuzzy matching capabilities

3. **API Layer** (in aliases.rs):
   - Database-backed alias matching
   - Fallback to fuzzy matching when needed

## Testing

Use the provided test scripts to verify system functionality:

- `test_alias_system.sh`: Runs a comprehensive test of alias matching for all entity types
- `add_missing_aliases.sh`: Adds specific aliases that were identified as missing during testing

## Example Usage

Database-backed alias matching can handle common entity name variations:

```
Apple Inc ↔ Apple
Microsoft Corporation ↔ Microsoft
Meta Platforms Inc ↔ Facebook ↔ FB
Jeffrey P. Bezos ↔ Jeff Bezos
United States of America ↔ USA
PlayStation 5 ↔ PS5
```

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding a cache layer for frequently accessed aliases
- Implement automatic alias discovery using pattern matching
- Add support for alias confidence scoring based on usage patterns
