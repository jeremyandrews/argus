      source_entities: &ExtractedEntities,
      target_entities: &ExtractedEntities,
      source_date: Option<&str>,
      target_date: Option<&str>,
  ) -> anyhow::Result<EntitySimilarityMetrics>
  ```

- **Matching Algorithm**: Refined threshold and weighting system:
  ```rust
  // Entity-specific weighting
  metrics.person_overlap = calculate_type_similarity_async(
      db,
      source_entities,
      target_entities,
      EntityType::Person,
      &normalizer,
  ).await?;

  // Combined score calculation with weighted components

## Previous Enhancement Project: Database-Driven Entity Alias System

We've implemented a comprehensive database-driven entity alias system to improve entity name matching and article clustering. This represents a significant architectural enhancement that moves from static, hard-coded aliases to a dynamic, database-backed approach that can learn and improve over time.

### Core Components

- **Database Schema**: Added tables and functions in `db.rs` for alias management:
  ```rust
  pub async fn add_entity_alias(...) -> Result<i64, sqlx::Error>
  pub async fn are_names_equivalent(...) -> Result<bool, sqlx::Error>
  pub async fn get_canonical_name(...) -> Result<Option<String>, sqlx::Error>
  pub async fn add_negative_match(...) -> Result<i64, sqlx::Error>
  pub async fn is_negative_match(...) -> Result<bool, sqlx::Error>
  pub async fn migrate_static_aliases(...) -> Result<usize, sqlx::Error>
  ```

- **Alias Discovery**: Added pattern-based detection in `aliases.rs`:
  ```rust
  pub fn extract_potential_aliases(...) -> Vec<(String, String, EntityType, f64)>
  ```

- **EntityNormalizer Enhancement**: Updated to use database aliases in `normalizer.rs`:
  ```rust
  pub async fn async_names_match(...) -> anyhow::Result<bool>
  ```

- **Entity Matching**: Enhanced with database-backed similarity calculation in `matching.rs`:
  ```rust
  pub async fn calculate_entity_similarity_async(...) -> anyhow::Result<EntitySimilarityMetrics>
  ```

- **Admin CLI**: Created comprehensive command-line interface in `manage_aliases.rs`

### Benefits Delivered

## Entity-Based Article Clustering

We've implemented a comprehensive entity-based system to improve article clustering and similarity matching with the following approach:

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Relational Entity Model**: Creating a complete relational database schema for entity management:
   - Dedicated tables for entities, entity-article relationships, and entity details
   - Proper indexing for efficient query patterns
   - Support for entity hierarchies, especially for locations
   - Cluster tracking and management

2. **Entity Extraction**: Adding Named Entity Recognition (NER) capability using structured LLM prompts to extract:
   - People with roles and affiliations
   - Organizations with types and industries
   - Locations with hierarchical relationships
   - Temporal information and events
   - Primary vs. secondary entity importance

3. **Multi-Factor Similarity**: Enhancing the existing vector-based matching with:
   - Entity overlap detection (shared people, organizations, locations)
   - Temporal proximity scoring (using publication and event dates)
   - Hierarchical location matching (handling geographic containment)
   - Refined similarity calculation that combines multiple factors

4. **Database Enhancements**:
   - New entity tables with proper relationships
   - Extended article schema with event_date and cluster_id
   - Comprehensive indexing strategy for performance
   - Cluster management tables

5. **Qdrant Integration**:
   - Extending payload schema to include entity data
   - Enhancing vector search with entity-aware filtering
   - Improving result ranking with multi-factor scoring

### Most Recent Fix: Vector Similarity Calculation Fix

We've identified and fixed a critical issue in the vector similarity calculation that was causing articles to incorrectly fail to match:

**Results**
- Articles now match correctly when they have both high vector similarity and sufficient entity overlap
- Testing with sample articles shows the issue is resolved:
  - Vector similarity between sample articles is now correctly calculated as 0.92 (92%) instead of 0.0
  - Combined with entity similarity of 0.515, the final score is 0.759 (above the 0.75 threshold)
  - Articles are now correctly identified as matches

- This fix significantly improves the accuracy of the article matching system by ensuring:
  1. Proper vector similarity calculation in all code paths
  2. Consistent handling of both vector and entity components of the similarity score
  3. Better error reporting when vector calculations fail
