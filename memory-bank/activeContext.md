# Active Development Context

## Current Focus: Vector Module Reorganization

We've just completed modularizing the `vector.rs` file, which was over 1,200 lines. Following the pattern established with the workers module, we've created a directory-based module structure to improve maintainability and readability.

### New Structure

The vector module is now organized as follows:

```
src/vector/
├── mod.rs           # Main exports, shared constants, and globals
├── config.rs        # Configuration and model initialization
├── embedding.rs     # Text to vector conversion
├── storage.rs       # Vector storage in Qdrant
├── similarity.rs    # Similarity calculation between vectors
├── search.rs        # Article search functions
└── types.rs         # Shared data structures
```

Each file now has a focused responsibility and stays under 500 lines for better maintainability.

## Previous Focus: Workers Module Reorganization

We previously completed a significant reorganization of the worker system, creating a modular structure that's more maintainable and easier to navigate. This reorganization was driven by the need to keep individual files under 500 lines for better maintainability and code organization.

### New Structure

The workers are now organized as follows:

```
src/workers/
├── mod.rs                 # Main module export
├── common.rs              # Shared functionality between workers
├── analysis/              # Analysis worker components
│   ├── mod.rs             # Module exports
│   ├── worker_loop.rs     # Main analysis worker loop
│   ├── processing.rs      # Processing logic
│   ├── quality.rs         # Quality assessment functionality
│   ├── similarity.rs      # Similarity calculation
│   └── entity_handling.rs # Entity extraction and processing
└── decision/              # Decision worker components
    ├── mod.rs             # Module exports
    ├── worker_loop.rs     # Main decision worker loop
    ├── processing.rs      # Processing logic
    ├── extraction.rs      # Article text extraction
    └── threat.rs          # Threat assessment functionality
```

### Key Changes

1. **Modular Design**: Both workers are now split into specialized modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Backward Compatibility**: The lib.rs file re-exports the worker modules to maintain backward compatibility with existing code
3. **Common Functionality**: Shared code between workers is now in a central `common.rs` file
4. **Size Reduction**: Each file is now smaller and focused on a specific task, making code easier to understand and maintain

### Using the New Structure

- For new code, import directly from the new module structure: `use argus::workers::...`
- Existing code continues to work through re-exports in lib.rs: `use argus::analysis_worker`
- The main worker loop functions remain the entry points for spawning workers

### Related Changes

- Updated the prompt module structure to support the new worker organization
- Fixed minor issues and warnings throughout the codebase
- Ensured all binary tools continue to work with the new structure

## Next Steps

Future work should continue using the modular approach:

1. When adding new functionality to workers, place it in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Keep files under 500 lines for maintainability
3. Put shared functionality in the common module
4. Consider if other large modules could benefit from similar reorganization
