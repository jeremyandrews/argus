6. **Life Safety Alerts**: Implementing geographical impact detection for safety-critical information
7. **Enhanced LLM Error Logging**: Improved connection identification in error logs to pinpoint failing LLM instances

## Current Enhancement Project: Entity-Based Article Clustering

We're implementing a comprehensive entity-based system to improve article clustering and similarity matching with the following approach:

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Relational Entity Model**: Creating a complete relational database schema for entity management:
   - Dedicated tables for entities, entity-article relationships, and entity details
   - Proper indexing for efficient query patterns
   - Support for entity hierarchies, especially for locations
   - Cluster tracking and management

2. **Entity Extraction**: Adding Named Entity Recognition (NER) capability using structured LLM prompts to extract:
   - People with roles and affiliations
   - Organizations with types and industries
   - Locations with hierarchical relationships
   - Temporal information and events
   - Primary vs. secondary entity importance

3. **Multi-Factor Similarity**: Enhancing the existing vector-based matching with:
   - Entity overlap detection (shared people, organizations, locations)
   - Temporal proximity scoring (using publication and event dates)
   - Hierarchical location matching (handling geographic containment)
   - Refined similarity calculation that combines multiple factors

4. **Database Enhancements**:
   - New entity tables with proper relationships
   - Extended article schema with event_date and cluster_id
   - Comprehensive indexing strategy for performance
   - Cluster management tables

5. **Qdrant Integration**:

### Current Focus: Enhanced Diagnostics for Entity Matching Issues

We're implementing comprehensive diagnostics to identify why entity-based related articles aren't appearing properly in the iOS app:

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Entity extraction and storage are working correctly:
  - Logs show successful extraction: `Successfully extracted 12 entities from article text`
  - Entities are properly stored in the database: `Successfully processed entity extraction for article 19134669 with 12 entities`
- However, when retrieving similar articles, the entity relationship information isn't being correctly used:
  - Logs show: `Building source entities from 0 entity IDs: []`
  - No logs found for "entities for article", indicating `get_article_entities` isn't being called

**Previous Fix Attempts**
- Enhanced `build_entities_from_ids` function to:
  - Try to determine source article ID from entity IDs via database lookup
  - Use `db.get_article_entities()` to get complete entity-article relationship data
  - Preserve proper importance levels from the database instead of assuming all are PRIMARY
  - Add better fallback mechanisms when direct lookup fails
- Improved `get_similar_articles_with_entities` function to:
  - Add direct entity retrieval from source article as a fallback
  - Include multiple recovery paths for entity data retrieval
  - Provide better logging for diagnostic purposes

**Enhanced Diagnostic Implementation**
- âœ… **Entity Matching Process** (in `matching.rs`):
  - Added detailed logging for entity similarity calculations with entity-by-entity comparison tracking
  - Added type-by-type breakdowns of entity comparisons (Person, Organization, Location, Event) 
  - Added critical error detection for when overlapping entities produce zero scores
  
- âœ… **Entity Retrieval Process** (in `vector.rs`):
  - Enhanced the `build_entities_from_ids` function with more detailed entity tracing
  - Added importance level and entity type breakdowns for easier troubleshooting
  - Added entity-by-entity logging with type and importance data
  - Added critical error detection when we fail to retrieve entities despite having valid entity IDs
  - Added tracking of entity-based versus vector-based matches
  
- âœ… **Database Entity Search** (in `db.rs`):
  - Added a preliminary query to count matching articles without date filtering
  - Added critical error reporting when date filtering eliminates all potential matches
  - Added sample output of articles being filtered by date to identify format issues
  - Enhanced logging of SQL execution with parameter values

**Root Cause Found and Fixed**
- âœ… Issue identified: Date filtering in `get_articles_by_entities_with_date` was eliminating all potential matches
- âœ… The problem was in the SQL date comparison: `AND a.pub_date > ?` wasn't properly comparing RFC3339 formatted dates
- âœ… Our enhanced diagnostics found that articles with matching entities were being found (hundreds of matches) but all were being eliminated by the date filter
- âœ… Direct SQL tests confirmed the issue: string comparison of dates was unreliable, but using `datetime()` functions worked properly

**Fix Implemented**
- âœ… Modified the SQL query in `db.rs` to use SQLite's `datetime()` function:
  ```sql
  AND datetime(a.pub_date) > datetime(?)
  ```
- âœ… This ensures proper date comparison regardless of string format differences
- âœ… Direct SQL testing confirmed the fix works correctly, finding matches within the date threshold

**Next Steps**
- ðŸ”„ Deploy the fix and verify related articles now appear in the app
- ðŸ”„ Monitor logs to ensure entity matching continues to work properly
- ðŸ”„ Consider adding additional validation for date fields to prevent similar issues

### Previous Focus: Fixing Inconsistent Entity-Based Article Matching

We've resolved multiple issues with the article similarity scoring system that were causing articles with no entity overlap to sometimes appear in "similar articles" results:

**First fix: Similarity weighting inconsistency**
- We implemented a dual-query approach for enhanced article matching that combines:
  - Vector similarity (60% weight)
  - Entity overlap (30% weight) 
  - Temporal proximity (10% weight)
- However, there was an inconsistency in the code:
  - For articles with entity data, we correctly applied the formula: `0.6 * vector_score + 0.4 * entity_similarity`
  - But for articles without entity data, we were using 100% of the vector score, bypassing our weighting system
  - This allowed articles with zero entity overlap to appear in results if their vector similarity was high enough (â‰¥0.75)

**Second fix: Missing consistent weighting in other code paths**
- After fixing the first issue, we discovered a second inconsistency in the `get_similar_articles_with_entities` function:
  - When articles without entities were found through vector-based searching, we correctly applied the 60% weighting in some code paths
  - But another code path for the same condition was using 100% of the vector score
  - This inconsistency allowed articles with no entity overlap to still appear in results

Previously completed fixes:
- âœ… Modified all code paths that handle articles without entity data to use `final_score = 0.6 * article.score`
- âœ… Updated all similarity formula descriptions to consistently say "60% vector similarity"
- âœ… Added detailed diagnostic logging throughout the entity extraction and matching process
- âœ… Added verification logging that confirms all final matches have entity overlap
- âœ… Added detailed pre-filter and post-filter logging to show exactly which articles are being filtered out and why

Impact of these changes:
- Articles without entity overlap will score a maximum of 0.6 (60% of perfect vector similarity)
- Since the threshold is 0.75, articles must have some entity overlap to appear in results
- The system now properly enforces the requirement that similar articles should share at least one entity
- Users will see more relevant, semantically connected content in similar articles sections
- Developers have much better visibility into the matching process through enhanced logging

### Previous Focus: Enhanced Article Matching Transparency

Recently completed:
- âœ… Enhanced `ArticleMatch` struct to expose detailed similarity metrics:
  - Added vector quality metrics (vector_score, vector_active_dimensions, vector_magnitude)
  - Added entity overlap metrics (entity_overlap_count, primary_overlap_count)
  - Added entity type-specific metrics (person_overlap, org_overlap, location_overlap, event_overlap)
  - Added temporal_proximity to show date-based similarity
  - Added similarity_formula field to explain the calculation methodology
- âœ… Updated all JSON outputs to include the new fields in similar articles sections
- âœ… Ensured backward compatibility with all existing functionality
- âœ… Verified implementation with `cargo check --bin argus` (no warnings)
- âœ… Added `get_articles_by_entities` method in db.rs to centralize database queries
- âœ… Implemented `get_similar_articles_with_entities` in vector.rs 
- âœ… Designed and implemented dual-query approach that combines vector and entity-based search results
- âœ… Enhanced transparency of similarity scoring with detailed metrics
- âœ… Added formula explanation showing the weighted contributions
