# Argus Project Intelligence

## Naming Conventions
- "Argus" references Argus Panoptes from Greek mythology - the all-seeing giant with many eyes
- Worker types use consistent naming: Decision Workers and Analysis Workers
- The system uses "topics" as the primary taxonomy for categorizing content

## Architecture Patterns
- Analysis Workers can dynamically switch to Decision Worker role when needed, then switch back
- Workers operate on queue-based model with database-backed persistence
- Each component can scale independently with multiple parallel workers
- Notification system has dual channels: Slack (team) and iOS app (individual)

## Project Workflows
- RSS feeds → Decision Workers → Matched Topics Queue → Analysis Workers → Notifications
- Life safety concerns follow a specialized path with geographical impact assessment
- iOS app authentication uses JWT tokens tied to device IDs

## Technology Conventions
- Rust with tokio for async processing
- SQLite with SQLx for database operations
- Local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI) LLM integration
- Prompt templates use structured format with consistent sections

## Quality Analysis
- Critical analysis examines source credibility and content quality
- Logical analysis identifies fallacies and reasoning quality
- Quality scoring uses a three-tier system (1-3) for quick assessment
- Insights go beyond article content to provide deeper context

## Entity-Based Article Matching
- Entity extraction uses structured LLM prompts to identify people, organizations, locations, and events
- Multi-factor similarity uses weighted combination of vector similarity (60%), entity overlap (30%), and temporal proximity (10%)
- Entity storage follows a normalized database schema with separate tables for entities and article-entity relationships
- Similarity functions should be consolidated not duplicated - avoid maintaining parallel implementations
- Entity importance is classified as PRIMARY, SECONDARY, or MENTIONED to prioritize matching weight

## Application Conventions
- iOS app relies on push notifications with payload size limits
- Detailed content is stored in R2 and linked in notifications
- Users subscribe to topics through the iOS app
- Quality filters allow users to set minimum quality thresholds
